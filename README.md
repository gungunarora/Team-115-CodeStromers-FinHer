# FinHer - Empowering Women Financially

## Tagline: **Simplify. Save. Succeed.**

FinHer is an innovative financial platform designed specifically for women to simplify financial management, automate savings, and build financial independence. With intuitive features, personalized insights, and secure transactions, FinHer empowers women—whether professionals or homemakers—to take control of their financial future with ease.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Women often face challenges in financial management due to time constraints, limited financial literacy, and restricted access to financial services. Juggling work and household responsibilities leaves little room for budgeting, saving, or investing. This lack of accessibility leads to dependency, missed investment opportunities, and difficulty in securing credit, preventing financial independence.
